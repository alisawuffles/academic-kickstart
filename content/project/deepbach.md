A major limitation of music generation systems for a specific domain is finite training data. In particular, in Bach chorale generation, data is inherently limited to the 389 chorales Bach wrote in his lifetime. Researchers have augmented this data with techniques such as transposition, which loses compositional information specific to its original key, or by extracting multiple short segments from each piece, which loses long-term coherence. We propose an alternative method which augments a dataset limited in training examples by using an existing modelâ€™s generated output weighted by a hand-crafted score function, to feed back as new training data to update the model. We try this method with DeepBach, a model trained to generate chorales in the style of Bach. Our hypothesis is that training on high-quality generated output is more useful than training on simple transformations of the same music.
