I really enjoy making study guides! Here are a couple I'm especially proud of, and I will update this post as time goes on.

[EECS 396: Statistical Machine Learning](../../files/study_guides/sml.pdf)
The professor shared the topic being tested by every problem on the final, so I organized course content around it.

[Math 312: Number Theory](../../files/study_guides/math_312.pdf)
One of my favorite classes (and subjects) of all time. I shared this with the class on Piazza (with permission from [Dr. Troupe](http://www.cs.uleth.ca/~troupe/), of course) and passed it on to many students who would take the course after me. I still hear from people who use it, which makes me really happy.

[Math 307: Applications of Linear Algebra](../../files/study_guides/math_307.pdf)
More of a formula sheet than a study guide.
