## Chorales graded by grading function
Here are three chorales generated by the same model. Before viewing the table of their grades below, listen to each three and rank them in terms of how Bach-like they are.

{{< audio mp3="../../audio/bach/grading_function/304.mp3" >}}
{{< figure src="../../img/bach/304.png" title="Chorale 2" width="60%">}}
{{< audio mp3="../../audio/bach/grading_function/93.mp3" >}}
{{< figure src="../../img/bach/93.png" title="Chorale 3" width="60%">}}

Which chorales did you think were better? Here are the grades of the three chorales. **Note:** Since the grade is a distance measure, *lower grades are better!*

|Chorale|Overall Grade|Note|Rhythm|Parallel Errors|Harmonic Quality|S Intervals|A Intervals|T Intervals|B Intervals|Repeated Sequence|
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
|1|54.026|0.314|0.413|44.835|1.645|0.923|1.344|0.988|0.948|2.617|
|2|8.386|0.167|0.327|2.031|0.567|0.640|0.498|0.720|0.996|2.440|
|3 (best)|3.893|0.301|0.199|0|0.328|0.345|0.396|0.680|0.597|1.047|

Chorale 1, while relatively short, is laden with parallel errors (especially in measure 3), which the grading function punishes. Chorale 2 has parallel octaves in measure 3 in the alto and bass voices (SATB order) starting on the second eighth note. Furthermore, it has seven D's in a row in the alto voice, which is punished by the "repeated sequence" portion of the grade. Chorale 3 contains no parallel errors.

## Paired evaluation
Want to test yourself? In each pair, one chorale was written by Bach and one was model-generated. In each pair, the grading function assigns a better grade to Bach but the decision may be challenging and time-consuming for human listeners. The answers are here[^1].

### Pair 1

{{< audio mp3="../../audio/bach/pairs/pair_1/bach_24.mp3" >}}
### Pair 2
{{< audio mp3="../../audio/bach/pairs/pair_2/bach_30.mp3" >}}
{{< audio mp3="../../audio/bach/pairs/pair_2/base_13.mp3" >}}
### Pair 3
{{< audio mp3="../../audio/bach/pairs/pair_3/base_35.mp3" >}}
{{< audio mp3="../../audio/bach/pairs/pair_3/bach_43.mp3" >}}


[^1]: (1) first chorale is generated (grade: 7.98), second chorale is Bach (grade: 4.94). (2) first chorale is Bach (grade: 5.01), second chorale is generated (grade: 5.26). (3) first chorale is generated (grade: 8.76), second chorale is Bach (grade: 3.82). **Note:** Since the grade is a distance measure, *lower grades are better!*
