Consider prime numbers — surely, the stuff of grade school. I remember being seven and delighted to recite the first 40 primes, until the digits of $\pi$ quickly became more fashionable and primes were forgotten forever more. For a long time, prime numbers simply seem too unpredictable in nature to consider in much depth; they merely pop up as they please along the number line. This seemed mysterious to me, but I did not think there is much more to it.

Fast forward twelve years and I am in my number theory class, completely intrigued when my professor revives this seemingly ancient topic. He quickly demonstrates that primes are commonly spaced two apart, but are there infinitely many such pairs? Yes, he proposes, and scratches “[The Twin Prime Conjecture](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/TwinPrimeConjecture.html)” onto the blackboard. This simple postulate has commanded the attention of mathematicians for centuries, and yet it is still just that — a postulate. That’s when it occurs to me that there is more to prime numbers than I might ever understand.

In the next few weeks, I learn the following: there is a closed formula to estimate the number of primes smaller than any given number. There are infinitely many primes of the form $4k+3$. For any given number $n$, there exist two consecutive primes at least $n$ apart.

Prime numbers have shown me that there is always more to learn, even where I least expect it. Something so simple never fails to yield surprising patterns, beautiful proofs, and new conjectures. As I look around me, I hope to always question what I think I know, and wonder what there still remains to explore.
