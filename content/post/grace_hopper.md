In the weeks leading up to Grace Hopper this October, I wasn't sure why I was going. The recruiting opportunities is one of the main pulls of the conference, and seems . There are many who would have loved to take my spot.

### Talks
On my first day at the conference, I mainly followed the AI track for talks, since this aligned most my research interests. Then I realized that this is really different from an academic conference, where talks present state-of-the-art research. I kept being surprised that the talks here are given by people in industry instead of in academia, where the goal is often building a lucrative product rather than advancing the state of human knowledge or machine capability. But what's special about Grace Hopper is that their talks span all areas and applications of technology, which isn't true of an NLP conference or ML conference. I found it much more valuable to view the talks at this conference as a way to learn about topics that I wouldn't otherwise be exposed to.

I've often been intimidated at academic conferences to ask questions, so asking them here was a really good exercise.

### University booths
Many universities have booths with graduate school admissions officers and current graduate students who will be really excited to hear that you're interested in their program! It's an amazing opportunity to get a feel for the school from real people.

Prepare some questions to ask about the application and what it's like being a PhD student at their school. Current students are often happy to chat. If you have some copies of your CV on you, you can ask an admissions officer to take a look and judge if you would be a competitive applicant. You can also simply ask, "If I leave a copy of this with you, is there any chance it will make it to someone?" Some took a picture of my CV and emailed it right away to a professor I was interested in, and some wrote the names of professors on the CV for later. Some booths had application fee waivers for those who stopped by to chat.

I found it really grounding to talk about graduate admissions with people. Speaking my intentions into reality, verbalizing my questions, and receiving feedback on my candidacy helped me feel more comfortable with preparing my application. 

### Poster session
There is a nestled-away poster session in the career fair room! It's super exciting to see other girls presenting their research, and they are all really eager to share their work. Compared to academic conferences, I also found the poster session much more casual and conducive to conversation.
