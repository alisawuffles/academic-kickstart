Developing a neural language model that generates definitions and paraphrases of noun compounds (e.g. “caramel popcorn”). We identified a large pool of noun compounds in text using a POS-tagging rule, and we are currently incorporating human-authored definitions for these unlabeled noun compounds to evaluate the impact of active learning on generation tasks.
