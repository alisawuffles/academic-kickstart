Hi! I am currently an undergraduate research intern on the [MOSAIC](https://mosaic.allenai.org/) team at AI2. I graduated this Spring from [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/) with majors in computer science and math. There, I did work in the fields of natural language processing and computer audition. I have been super fortunate to work with Professor [Doug Downey](https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~ddowney/), Professor [Bryan Pardo](https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~pardo/), and Dr. [Prem Seetharaman](https://pseeth.github.io/), who have been the kindest of mentors and completely formative to my intellectual interests.

I am super excited to join the [University of Washington](http://www.washington.edu/) in Fall 2020 as a PhD student in the CSE department.
